# Ph.D. Ricardo Bortolotti

🙋‍♂️ Hi there! I'm Ricardo Bortolotti, and this is my Data Science & Machine Learning repository. 👋
🎓 I hold a Ph.D. in Mathematics since 2014, with a strong academic background and publications in top-tier journals.
👨‍🏫 I spent 10 years as a Professor at one of Brazil’s top federal universities, teaching and supervising research in pure mathematics.
👔 In 2024, I transitioned into Data Science to apply mathematical and statistical modeling to real-world challenges.
💼 I currently work as a Data Analyst at a fintech, focusing on analytics and modeling to optimize debt collection strategies.
🤖 I'm passionate about solving complex problems using Data Science, Machine Learning, and rigorous mathematical thinking.
