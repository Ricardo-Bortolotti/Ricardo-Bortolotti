# Ph.D. Ricardo Bortolotti

Hi, there! I am Ricardo Bortolotti and this is my Data Science / Machine Learning repository! 👋

+ 🙋‍♂️ I am Ph.D. in Mathematics since 2014.
+ 👔 I have experience of 10 years as a Professor in one of the best federal universities of Brazil.
+ 🪙 Currently my enthusiasm lies in Data Science / Machine Learning, mainly on algorithms strongly related to Statistics and Mathematics (see my projects below).

## Skills

+ ⌨️ Hard skills: Mathematics (calculus, linear algebra, optimization, probability, measure theory, dynamical systems), Statistics (descriptive and inferential, hypothesis testing, A/B testing, time series analysis), Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels, scipy, scikit-learn, tensorflow, keras), SQL, R, PowerBI, Machine Learning (classification, regression, clustering, feature engineering, model optimization, deep learning).
+ 👨🏻‍🏫 Soft skills: self-directed learning, effective communication, teamwork, quick adaptability, enthusiasm, passion for data and numbers, and a results-oriented approach.

## Mathematics Professor

After my Ph.D., I worked for 10 years as an academic at UFPE (Universidade Federal de Pernambuco). I published scientific papers in high-impact scientific journals and taught classes for graduation and undergraduation in mathematics, statistics, physics, computation and engineering.

### Scientific Research

My research focused on the area of Dynamical Systems and Ergodic Theory.
